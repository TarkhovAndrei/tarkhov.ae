longevity researcher with a phd in theoretical physics. my dream is to understand why we age and leverage it to significantly impact human health and longevity. <br><br>long-term: I work on understanding the fundamental mechanisms of aging through compbio & applied ai, physics & chaos theory with the goal to find practical ways extend longevity. <br><br>currently at retro.bio, building applied ai to facilitate the development of life-extending and anti-aging therapies.
