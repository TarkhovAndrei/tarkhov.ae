### The development of my understanding of physics in papers

Physics:
1. Laser physics and nonlinear optics (3D + time, NLSE)
1. Biophysics — instruments
1. BKT transition, 2D simulations (Peter), phase transitions
1. Solid state physics and self-organization (2D + time)
1. CUDA simulations for seismic problems JINR
1. Superconductivity — simulations of 1D systems
1. Classical and quantum chaos
1. Quantum simulators (ultra cold atoms, 1D DGPE)
1. Thermalization and dynamical foundations of statistical physics (1D, 3D DGPE, CUDA/GPUs). Dynamics in 3D, simulations. Phase transitions, non-equilibrium quenches through a phase transition, topological defects, inducing non-Gibbs states (negative temperature states)
1. Meanwhile system administration of our clusters
